## Getting started

* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package.json`. You just need run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `dev`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes. Once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
